To-Do List Application with Python and Django: Getting Started

Workflow:

- Define user stories: Break down the project into smaller tasks with clear goals and acceptance criteria.

- Iterative development: Work on features incrementally, testing thoroughly after each step.

- Version control: Use Git to track changes and revert if needed.

- Deployment: Consider deploying your app to a web server like Heroku or AWS for public access.

Development Tools:

Text Editor/IDE: Choose a comfortable editor like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Sublime Text.

Version Control System: Use Git for version control and collaboration.

Testing Framework: Use Django's built-in testing framework or libraries like pytest for unit and integration testing.

Code Linting: Use tools like Pylint or Flake8 to enforce code style and identify potential issues.

Deployment Tools: Use tools like Heroku CLI or AWS CLI for easier deployment.

Additional Tips:

Research existing To-Do list applications for inspiration and features.
Prioritize essential features first and add more complex ones later.
Keep your code clean, readable, and well-commented.
Don't hesitate to seek help from Django communities and online resources.
